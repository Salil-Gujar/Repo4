Hey girl, I'm waiting on ya
I'm waiting on ya
Come on let me sneak you out 
and have a celebration, a celebration
the music got the windows down
yea, we will keep doing what we do 
just pretending that we cool
and we know it too
yea, we will keep doing what we do
just that we cool 
so tonight
lets go crazy crazy crazy till we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love 
and never ever ever stop for anyone 
tonight let's get some and
live while we're young

Hey girl, it's now or never...
And if we get together, get together..
